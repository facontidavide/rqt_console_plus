# rqt_console_plus

This GUI is meant to be used as a replacement of [rqt_console](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_console).

Someone might reasonably ask: "dude, what that __really__ necessary?"

The answer is of course "no".

What this version offers is:

- A slightly different GUI. You may prefer it or not.
- Multiple tabs (I really need them).
- Save and load your parameters, configurtion and layout in a file.
- It can either subscribe to `/rosout` or/and load the log messages from a rosbag.
- It is written in C++ (rqt_console uses Python).
